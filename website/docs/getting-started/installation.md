# Installation

Getting started with Hexagon is easy. This guide will walk you through the installation process.

## Prerequisites

Hexagon requires Python 3.9 or higher. Make sure you have Python installed on your system before proceeding.

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install or upgrade Python, visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installing Hexagon

Hexagon is available on PyPI and can be installed using pipx:

```bash
pipx install hexagon
```

This will install the latest stable version of Hexagon and all its dependencies.

## Verifying the Installation

To verify that Hexagon was installed correctly, run:

```bash
hexagon --version
```

You should see the current version of Hexagon displayed.

## Running Hexagon

Once installed, you can run Hexagon by simply typing:

```bash

```

This will start the Hexagon CLI. If this is your first time running Hexagon, you'll see the default Hexagon CLI which includes tools for creating and managing your own custom CLIs.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Hexagon installed, you can proceed to the [Quick Start](quick-start) guide to learn how to create your first custom CLI.
